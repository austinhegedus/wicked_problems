# DATA 100 - Wicked Problems
Hello my name is Austin Hegedus and I am planning to become a finance major here at William and Mary.  I like to play and watch sports like basketball and soccer.  I enjoy activities like hiking and rock climbing and the outdoors in general.  I enjoy traveling across the country and around the world.  I recently took a trip up to New England to visit all of those states.
